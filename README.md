## Description

I have taken the original code for the site and refactored it to make it more accessible to screen readers through the use of semantic html as well as alt text for images.

Visually impaired people must be able to use the internet to accomplish the same goals as everyone else, as disabled people should not be excluded from society. This is especially pertinent given that many societies now assume universal constant internet access and structure themselves accordingly. This can make it harder to have access to the same opportunities for necessities such as socializing, finding and keeping up with work, paying bills, applying for aid or education, and more without the accomodations needed to make browsing not only functional but vibrant in what it can display. Proper formatting of semantic html and headers allows screen readers to navigate a website more accurately to how it is intended, and the inclusion of alt text for images allows the integration of used images into the understanding that the screen reader can create.

This project demonstrates use of the HTML and CSS languages, adherence to baseline accessibility standards, attention to needs often left outside the main scope of work, and adherence to the ideal of the scout's rule.
